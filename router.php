 * Router script for PHP's built-in server (`php -S host:port router.php`).
 * Lets every page be reached without its ".html" extension in the URL
 * (e.g. /announcements instead of /announcements.html), while every other
 * request — API endpoints (.php), images, CSS, JS — is served exactly as
 * before, unaffected by this file.
 *
 * How PHP's built-in server treats a router script: for every request, it
 * calls this script first. Returning false hands the request back to the
 * server's own default static-file/PHP-execution handling; returning true
 * (or just letting the script finish after echoing output) means this
 * script fully handled the response itself.
