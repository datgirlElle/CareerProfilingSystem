 * Other names a course may have in the Weka dataset's class column, keyed by the
 * program title stored in `programs` (see db/program_codes.php). Matching ignores
 * case, spaces, dots and hyphens, and the program title itself always matches.
 *
 * Same list as evaluation/cbf_eval.py's COURSE_ALIASES (which the dataset tools use),
 * so a class label written by those tools always resolves to a program here.
 * Ambiguous abbreviations (e.g. BSMT) are deliberately left out.
